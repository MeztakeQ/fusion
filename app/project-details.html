                                    Having a baby can be a nerve wracking experience for new parents – not the nine
                                    months of pregnancy, I’m talking about after the infant is brought home from the
                                    hospital. It’s always the same thing, by the time they have their third child they
                                    have it all figured out, but with number one it’s a learning thing.

                                    Baby monitors help you hear your baby’s needs without you having to be in the room
                                    with the baby. Some baby monitors are portable, or “mobile” and are small enough
                                    that you can carry it in your pocket as you do your daily chores around the house.
                                    Depending on your price range it’s best to have a base unit that plugs into the
                                    wall. The receiving unit can be like your portable phone, you can carry it around
                                    with you, and plug it back into the base unit to be recharged.
